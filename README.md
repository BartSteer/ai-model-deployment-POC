# testAIdeployment
This application was used as a learning experience. teaching me how to deploy a working AI model application onto dockerhub and desktop using Kubernetes. 
The deployment process uses gitlab CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment process by building an image on docker.

The application is a simple AI model, that functions within its own environment.
The challenge came from automating the deployment, and transfering environmental variables using gitlab CI/CD pipelines
